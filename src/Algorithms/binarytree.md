# Binary Tree

- If every node has either 0 or 2 children, a binary tree is called full.
- If the lowest d-1 levels of a binary tree of height d are filled and
level d is partially filled from left to right, the tree is called
complete.
- If all d levels of a height-d binary tree are filled, the tree is called
perfect.

- A perfect tree of height h has \\(2^{h+1} - 1\\) nodes.

- In a non-empty, full binary tree, the number of internal nodes is always 1 less
than the number of leaves.
