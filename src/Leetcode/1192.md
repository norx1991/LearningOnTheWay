[1192. Critical Connections in a Network](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network) (Hard)  

> There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.
> A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.
> Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
