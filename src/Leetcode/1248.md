[1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays)

> Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it. Return the number of nice sub-arrays.

```python
def numberOfSubarrays2(self, nums, k): 
        i = count = nice_count = odd_count = 0 # The variable "count" is needed because when "j" hits an even number, it still need to add count
        for j in range(len(nums)): 
            if nums[j] % 2 == 1: 
                odd_count += 1 
                count = 0  # Note that when the number is even, count will remain constant
            while odd_count == k: 
                odd_count -= nums[i] % 2 
                i += 1 
                count += 1 
            nice_count += count 
        return nice_count
