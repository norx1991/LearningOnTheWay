[1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination)

> You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.
> Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) given that you can eliminate at most k obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.

### BFS
This question is very similar to [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](Leetcode/../787.md)

        lowest = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)] # The minimum number of obstacles that need to be removed
        lowest[0][0] = 0

        while dq:
            r, c, nstep, nremoval = dq.popleft()
            if r == m - 1 and c == n - 1:

                nremoval_new = nremoval + grid[newr][newc]

                    dq.append((newr, newc, nstep + 1, nremoval_new))
