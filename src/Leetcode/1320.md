[1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-to-type-a-word-using-two-fingers)

    # Because of symmetry, dp[i][j] represent the minimum total distance when the current position is at i (so one finger must be at i-th letter) and another figure is at j-th letter. Here we label the first letter in the sequence as 1. So the maximum value of i is N. 0 is reserved for the initial state.

        # To get to the state of (i, j) where j = 0, 1, ..., i - 2, the only possible way is to move from the figure at i - 1 to i  
        for j in range(i - 1): 
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dist(i, i - 1) 
        # To get to the state of (i, i - 1), the last state can be (i - 1, k) where k can be 0, 1, ..., i - 2
