[1340. Jump Game V](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-v)

> Given an array of integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

- i + x where: i + x < arr.length and 0 < x <= d.
- i - x where: i - x >= 0 and 0 < x <= d.
In addition, you can only jump from index i to index j if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)).

> You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.

class Solution:
    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        
        dp = [1] * (len(arr) + 1)
        
        for i, v in enumerate(arr + [float('inf')]):
            # This is using "<", not "<=", because if there are several same numbers, others can jump to either of them and either has a chance to be the optimal step. For different numbers within range, it is always good to jump to a larger number
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < v:
                last = stack.pop()
                L = [last]
                while stack and arr[stack[-1]] == arr[last]:
                    L.append(stack.pop())
                
                for j in L:
                    if i - j <= d:
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
                
                    if stack and j - stack[-1] <= d:
                        dp[stack[-1]] = max(dp[stack[-1]], dp[j] + 1)
            stack.append(i)
                    
        dp[-1] = 0
