```python
def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int: 
    N = len(ratings) 
        
    leftArray = [1] * N 
        
    for i in range(1, N): 
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]: 
            leftArray[i] = leftArray[i - 1] + 1 
        
    for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1): 
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]: 
            leftArray[i] = max(leftArray[i], leftArray[i + 1] + 1) 
                
    return sum(leftArray)
