[1597. Build Binary Expression Tree From Infix Expression](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-binary-expression-tree-from-infix-expression)

> A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), '*' (multiplication), and '/' (division).

> For each internal node with operator o, the infix expression that it represents is (A o B), where A is the expression the left subtree represents and B is the expression the right subtree represents.

> You are given a string s, an infix expression containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses '(' and ')'.

> Return any valid binary expression tree, which its in-order traversal reproduces s after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below).

> Please note that order of operations applies in s. That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

> Operands must also appear in the same order in both s and the in-order traversal of the tree.
