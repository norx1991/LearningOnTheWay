[160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists)

> Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

> For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

> The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

> Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

```python
def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    pA = headA
    pB = headB

    while pA != pB:
        pA = headB if pA is None else pA.next
        pB = headA if pB is None else pB.next

    return pA
