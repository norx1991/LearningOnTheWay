[162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element)

> A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
> Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
> You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
> You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

```python
def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    low = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
        
    return low
