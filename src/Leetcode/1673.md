[1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence)

> Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.
> An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
> We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.

### Monotone stack

```python
def mostCompetitive(self, A, k): 
        stack = [] 
        for i, a in enumerate(A): 
            while stack and stack[-1] > a and len(stack) - 1 + len(A) - i >= k: 
                stack.pop() 
            if len(stack) < k: 
                stack.append(a) 
        return stack
```
