[1696. Jump Game VI](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vi)

> You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.

> You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.

> You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.

> Return the maximum score you can get.


```python
def maxResult(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int: 
    N = len(nums) 
        
    score = nums[-1] 
    q = collections.deque() 
    q.append((nums[-1], N - 1)) 
        
    for start in reversed(range(N - 1)): 
        while q and q[-1][1] - start > k: 
            q.pop() 
        score = nums[start] + q[-1][0] 
        while q and score >= q[0][0]: 
            q.popleft() 
        q.appendleft((score, start)) 
        
    return score
```
