[1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost)

> You are given an m x n integer matrix points (0-indexed). Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.

> To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.

> However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 <= r < m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.

> Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.

```python
def maxPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(points), len(points[0])
    
    dp_prev = points[0]
    dp = [0] * n
    
    for r in range(1, m):            
        leftMax = [dp_prev[0]]
        for i in range(1, n):
            leftMax.append(max(dp_prev[i], leftMax[-1] - 1))
        
        rightMax = [dp_prev[-1]]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            rightMax.append(max(dp_prev[i], rightMax[-1] - 1))
        rightMax = rightMax[::-1]
        
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i] = max(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) + points[r][i]
                
        dp_prev = dp[:]
    return max(dp_prev)
