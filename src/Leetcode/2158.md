[2158. Amount of New Area Painted Each Day](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-new-area-painted-each-day)

> There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array paint of length n, where paint[i] = [starti, endi]. This means that on the ith day you need to paint the area between starti and endi.

> Painting the same area multiple times will create an uneven painting so you only want to paint each area of the painting at most once.

> Return an integer array worklog of length n, where worklog[i] is the amount of new area that you painted on the ith day.

### Line sweep

Here it is using heap. If you use a binary search tree (SortedList), the logic is more natural

```python
class Solution(object):
    def amountPainted(self, paint):
        """
        :type paint: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        points = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i, (s, e) in enumerate(paint):
            points[s].append((True, i))
            points[e].append((False, i))
        min_heap = []
        exited = [False]*len(paint)
        result = [0]*len(paint)
        prev = -1
        for pos in sorted(points.iterkeys()):
            while min_heap and exited[min_heap[0]]:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)

            # Till this point, the segment right before this event is for the one with highest priority
            if min_heap:
                result[min_heap[0]] += pos-prev

            prev = pos
            for is_enter, i in points[pos]:
                if is_enter:
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, i)
                else:
                    exited[i] = True
        return result
```
