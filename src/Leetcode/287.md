[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number)

> Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

> There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

> You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

```python
def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int: 
    slow = fast = 0 
        
    while True: 
        slow = nums[slow] 
        fast = nums[nums[fast]] 
        if slow == fast: 
            break 
            
    slow = 0 
        
    while slow != fast: 
        slow, fast = nums[slow], nums[fast] 
            
    return slow
