[312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons)

> You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

> If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

> Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

```python
from functools import lru_cache 
class Solution: 
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int: 
        # reframe the problem 
        nums = [1] + nums + [1] 
        # cache this 
        @lru_cache(None) 
        def dp(left, right): 
            if left + 1 == right: return 0 
            # add each balloon on the interval and return the maximum score 
            return max(nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] + dp(left, i) + dp(i, right) for i in range(left+1, right)) 
        # find the maximum number of coins obtained from adding all balloons from (0, len(nums) - 1) 
        return dp(0, len(nums)-1)
