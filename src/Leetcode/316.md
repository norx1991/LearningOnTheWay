[316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters)

> Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

```python
def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str: 
    ct = collections.Counter(s)              
    stack = [] 
    seen = set() 
     
    for i, c in enumerate(s): 
        if c in seen: 
            ct[c] -= 1 
            continue 
        while stack and s[stack[-1]] >= c and ct[s[stack[-1]]] > 1: 
            idx = stack.pop() 
            seen.remove(s[idx]) 
            ct[s[idx]] -= 1 
        stack.append(i) 
        seen.add(c) 
         
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in stack])
