[317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings)

> You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:

> each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
> each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
> each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
> You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

> Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.
> The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.
