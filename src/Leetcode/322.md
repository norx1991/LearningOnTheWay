[322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

> You are given an integer array coinsrepresenting coins of different denominations and an integer amountrepresenting a total amount of money.
> Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
> You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


```python
def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        inf = float('inf')
        dp = [inf] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(len(dp)):
            for c in coins:
                if i - c < 0:
                    continue
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - c])
                
        return dp[-1] if dp[-1] != inf else -1
