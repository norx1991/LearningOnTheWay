[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum)

> Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
> The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
> It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

### Use dynamic programming
```python
def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:    
    dp = [[] for _ in range(target + 1)]  
    dp[0] = [[]] 
     
    for c in candidates: # It is not ok to reverse the inner and outer loop here
        for j in range(c, target + 1): 
            for x in dp[j - c]: 
                dp[j].append(x + [c]) 
                 
    return dp[-1]
```

### Use backtrack
```python
def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]: 
    stack = [] 
    res = [] 
    candidates.sort()  # Need to sort here
    def backtrack(remain, startidx): 
        for i in range(startidx, len(candidates)): 
            if candidates[i] > remain: 
                break
            elif candidates[i] == remain: 
                res.append(stack + [candidates[i]]) 
                break
            else: 
                stack.append(candidates[i]) 
                backtrack(remain - candidates[i], i) 
                stack.pop() 
                 
    backtrack(target, 0) 
    return res
```
