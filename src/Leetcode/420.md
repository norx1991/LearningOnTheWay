[420. Strong Password Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker)

> A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
- It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
- It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
- It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).
> Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.

In one step, you can:

- Insert one character to password,
- Delete one character from password, or
- Replace one character of password with another character.

    else: 
#If length of the string is larger than 20, we will need to delete some chars and appropriate deletion can reduce the number of replacements needed to break repeating sequences #after deletion. For any repeating sequences with len % 3 == 0, we need to make len/3 replacements and we can reduce the number of replacements len/3 by one by deleting one #character. Similarly, for any repeating sequences with len % 3 == 1, we can reduce one replacement by deleting two characters. Now we know that for all sequences, including #those already deleted chars from, we have len % 3 == 2 so we can reduce every replacement by deleting three characters such that every deleting action counts.
        delete = len(s) - 20 
            
        change -= min(delete, one) 
        change -= min(max(delete - one, 0), two * 2) // 2 
        change -= max(delete - one - 2 * two, 0) // 3 
                
        return delete + max(missing_type, change)
