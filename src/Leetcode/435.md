[435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals)

> Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

```python
def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals):
    end = float('-inf')
    erased = 0
    for i in sorted(intervals, key=lambda i: i.end):
        if i.start >= end:
            end = i.end
        else:
            erased += 1
    return erased
```
