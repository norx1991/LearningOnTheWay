[587. Erect the Fence](https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence)

> You are given an array trees where trees[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of a tree in the garden.

> You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if all the trees are enclosed.

> Return the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter.

### Convex Hull

```python
def outerTrees(self, trees: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]: 
    def ccw(p1, p2, p3): 
        v1x = p2[0] - p1[0] 
        v1y = p2[1] - p1[1] 
        v2x = p3[0] - p2[0] 
        v2y = p3[1] - p2[1] 
            
        res = (v1x * v2y - v2x * v1y)  
        if res > 0: 
            return 1 
        elif res == 0: 
            return 0 
        else: 
            return -1 
        
    trees.sort() 
        
    def compute_hull(target): 
        upper = [] 
        for i in range(len(trees)): 
            upper.append(i) 
            while len(upper) >= 3 and ccw(trees[upper[-3]], trees[upper[-2]], trees[upper[-1]]) not in target: 
                last = upper.pop() 
                upper.pop() 
                upper.append(last) 
                
        return upper 
        
    upper = compute_hull([0, -1]) 
    lower = compute_hull([0, 1]) 
        
    lower.reverse() 
                    
    return [trees[i] for i in set(upper + lower[1:-1])]
