[696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings)

> Given a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

> Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

```python
class Solution(object): 
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s): 
        groups = [1] 
        for i in xrange(1, len(s)): 
            if s[i-1] != s[i]: 
                groups.append(1) 
            else: 
                groups[-1] += 1 
        ans = 0 
        for i in xrange(1, len(groups)): 
            ans += min(groups[i-1], groups[i]) 
        return ans
