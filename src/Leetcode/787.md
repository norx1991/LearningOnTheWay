[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops)

> There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

> You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return-1
