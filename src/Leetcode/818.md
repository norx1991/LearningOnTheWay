[818. Race Car](https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car)

> Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):

When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
position += speed
speed *= 2
When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
If your speed is positive then speed = -1
otherwise speed = 1
Your position stays the same.
For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.

Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

### Dynamic Programming with breadth-first search

```python
class Solution:
    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:
        dist = {(0, 1): 0}
        
        from collections import deque
        
        dq = deque([(0, 1)])
        
        while dq:
            pos, speed = dq.popleft()
            if pos == target:
                return dist[(pos, speed)]
            neighbors = [(pos, -speed // abs(speed)), (pos + speed, 2 * speed)]
            for nei in neighbors:
                if nei not in dist:
                    dq.append(nei)
                    dist[nei] = dist[(pos, speed)] + 1
```

### Dynamic Programming combined with Greedy (Time O(TlogT), Space O(T))

```python
class Solution:
    @cache
    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:
        n = target.bit_length()
        
        # Just use consecutive A and you will get there
        if (target + 1) & target == 0:  # This is the binary trick to see if target + 1 is a power of 2
            return n
        
        # Go past the target, then come back.
        result = self.racecar(2 ** n - 1 - target) + n + 1 # The "n" mean first use n consecutive A, then "1" means use 1 R
        
        # Go as long as you do not pass the target. Then come back several steps. Then go ahead.
        for m in range(n - 1):
            result = min(result,  + self.racecar(target - (2 ** (n - 1) - 2 ** m)) + n - 1 + 1 + m + 1) # The "n - 1" means first use (n - 1) A, then use 1 R, then use m A, m will be smaller than n - 1, then use 1 R
        
        return result
```
