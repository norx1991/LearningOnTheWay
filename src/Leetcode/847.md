[847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes)

> You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

> Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.


### DFS

```python
def shortestPathLength(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> int: 
    cache = {} # Will cause infitite loop if using @cache 
    def steps(node, status): 
        if (node, status) in cache: 
            return cache[node, status] 
        if status & (status - 1) == 0: 
            return 0 
        cache[node, status] = float('inf') # This is the key to avoid infinite loop 
        for neighbor in graph[node]: 
            if status & (1 << neighbor):  
                cache[node, status] = min(cache[node, status], 1 + steps(neighbor, status), 1 + steps(neighbor, status ^ (1 << node))) 
        return cache[node, status] 
    final_status = (1 << len(graph)) - 1 
    return min(steps(node, final_status) for node in range(len(graph)))
```

### BFS
```python
def shortestPathLength(self, graph): 
    if len(graph) == 1: 
        return 0 
     
    n = len(graph) 
    final_status = (1 << n) - 1 
    queue = collections.deque([(node, 1 << node) for node in range(n)]) 
    seen = set(queue) 
    steps = 1 
    while queue: 
        for _ in range(len(queue)): 
            node, status = queue.popleft() 
            for neighbor in graph[node]: 
                next_status = status | (1 << neighbor) 
                if next_status == final_status: 
                    return steps 
                 
                if (neighbor, next_status) not in seen: 
                    seen.add((neighbor, next_status)) 
                    queue.append((neighbor, next_status)) 
         
        steps += 1
```
