[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/)

> Given an array A of positive integers, call a (contiguous, not necessarily distinct) subarray of A good if the number of different integers in that subarray is exactly K.

> (For example, [1,2,3,1,2] has 3 different integers: 1, 2, and 3.)

> Return the number of good subarrays of A.
